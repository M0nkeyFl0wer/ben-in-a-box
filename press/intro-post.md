# Introducing Ben in a Box — A Soft, Smart, Remote Presence Device

Hi folks — I'm Ben.

I live with a disability that makes it tough to attend conferences and meetings in person. So, I built **Ben in a Box** — a friendly, fuzzy telepresence device that lets me show up anyway.

It’s a human-face-sized cube, soft enough to toss across a room, smart enough to stream my face in real-time, and secure enough to keep my data private. Powered by a Raspberry Pi and wrapped in pastel fur, it’s designed for accessibility, affordability, and playfulness.

Let’s make remote presence joyful, affordable, and inclusive.

With care,  
Ben
