# Ben in a Box

**Ben in a Box** is an open-source, friendly, face-sized telepresence device designed to help people — especially those living with disabilities — attend conferences, meetings, and social gatherings remotely.

This prototype uses a Raspberry Pi with camera, microphone, speaker, and a square screen to transmit audio/video through an encrypted peer-to-peer connection using WebRTC. The device is enclosed in a durable, fuzzy 3D-printed case with plushy controls, designed to be tossed around a room.

## Why it matters
Everyone will live with some form of disability in their lifetime. That shouldn’t be the end of your ability to contribute, connect, or participate. This project was started to solve that problem personally — and maybe for others, too.

Ben in a Box also makes remote interaction more fun, accessible, and engaging for everyone — not just people with disabilities. It’s for anyone who wants to reduce commuting, and still be fully present.
