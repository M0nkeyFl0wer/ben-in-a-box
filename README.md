# Ben in a Box (a.k.a. *You in a Box*)

What if remote participation felt more like *being there*?

**Ben in a Box** is an early-stage prototype for a soft, fuzzy, human-face-sized telepresence device. It's designed to help people — especially those of us living with disabilities — attend meetings, conferences, or events in a more engaging, embodied way.

This project is still in its **conceptual and prototyping phase**. The vision is open, collaborative, and community-driven.

## Why build this?

Remote access tools often fall short — especially for folks with mobility limitations, fatigue, chronic illness, or sensory issues. 

We deserve more than a black box on mute.

Because people with disabilities deserve to show up fully—and when we build for that, *everyone* benefits.

**Ben in a Box** started as a way to make telepresence more humane. Not just “can someone call in,” but *how do we actually include them*? Wheel someone’s laptop around a conference? Open a Zoom window awkwardly in a room where no one’s looking at it? We’ve all seen how that plays out.

A joyful, useful, *practical* little box that helps someone actually *feel there*—and be seen.

We’re building this because inclusion shouldn’t be an afterthought—and because making things better for people with disabilities almost always makes things better for everyone else too.

This project began as a personal accessibility tool. But really, it’s about **you**. That’s why the end goal is:  
**You in a Box** — a customizable, open-source presence tool anyone can adapt and build.

## What it is (and isn’t — yet)

**Right now**, this is:
- A concept with early mockups and working design schematics
- A 3D-printable housing for Raspberry Pi-based video presence
- A working outline for local captioning (Whisper/Vosk)
- A community project looking for collaborators

**It’s not yet**:
- A plug-and-play product
- A finished software stack
- Fully documented or tested across environments

But that’s where you come in.

## What it could become

If there's enough interest, this could evolve into:
- A community-maintained platform for remote presence
- A series of downloadable or purchasable DIY kits
- A space for creative experimentation around avatars, embodiment, and accessibility

We want to make something that *feels good to use* — something soft, personal, and a little weird in the best way.


This repo collects design notes, scripts, mockups, and eventually build instructions. The goal is a portable, low-cost, open-source kit that lets someone show up in physical space using tools t already have (like a Raspberry Pi and a webcam).

## What’s in this repo

assets/: Visual concepts and mockups (see ben-in-a-box.png)

docs/: Early documentation like assembly.md

hardware/3d-models/: Will include CAD files (OpenSCAD for now)

software/scripts/: Setup scripts (e.g. for Raspberry Pi or browser kiosk mode)

press/: Public-facing writing and intro post (intro-post.md)


---

## Planned features

Video + audio streaming through a small screen

Human-sized framing to center the face, not the screen

Captions or Whisper-based speech-to-text for accessibility

USB microphone & webcam support

3D-printable enclosure with soft or swappable skins


---

## Roadmap

[x] Mockups + design exploration

[ ] Basic video call proof of concept (WebRTC)

[ ] Raspberry Pi prototype

[ ] Whisper integration for local captioning

[ ] Optional audio input/output filter for voice modulation, clarity, or accessibility

> Because remote doesn’t have to mean robotic.

## How you can help

We're looking for:
- Feedback on the concept
- Thoughts from disabled and chronically ill folks who might use it
- Hardware suggestions or alternative designs
- WebRTC devs, open source hardware nerds, educators, and accessibility champions
- People who want to help build *You in a Box*

Want to contribute? Open an issue, start a discussion, or fork the repo and share your remix.

## Questions we’re asking

- Should this stay Raspberry Pi-based or expand to other platforms?
- Should there be a web controller or mobile pairing app?
- What’s the best way to simplify pairing for non-tech users?
- Could this integrate with avatars or animated faces?
- What would make this feel joyful and comfortable for you?

MIT. Free to use, remix, and adapt — especially if you make it softer, weirder, or more inclusive.
